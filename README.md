DiscordBotsV1.0

Repository for .NET based discord bots by GaburuRieru
Uses the unofficial discord bot wrapper by DISCORD.NET

CuteNoisesBot:
- Bot that plays anime voices
- The voices need to be added into the "Noises" folder and "NoiseBank.json" has to be updated with the new commands and path to the new noises

HololivePlaySound:
- Like CuteNoisesBot but made for playsound clips from various Hololive Vtubers

Hosted on Linux VMs either self-hosted or cloud sites like AWS.
